the av test driver took control after engaging the autonomous system due to immediate unexpected behavior of the system.  the av safety drivers are trained to take control proactively should the system not operate as expected. ,57,Computer System,System
"the av test driver took control from the autonomous system due to undesirable lane placement.  av test drivers consider various factors, including the amount of traffic and the behavior of any surrounding vehicles. in addition to their own perception, an in-vehicle display provides input on the vehicle's lane placement.  also incorporated is an advanced system for fluid exchange between the driver and the system without the need for buttons or switches.  this allows the av test drivers to take control to provide a transitory adjustment.  in this case, the av test driver took control from the autonomous system in response to the lateral movement of the vehicle within the lane.

the av test driver took control of the vehicle due to unexpected road conditions rendering continued av operation unadvisable.  these may include unexpected sun glare or other unplanned conditions.  ,85,Design Bug,ML/Design
"the autonomous system perceives and understands the environment by processing raw camera and radar inputs, detecting surfaces and objects in a scene, and calculating distance, velocity and motion vector for every pixel.  ghost av test drivers are trained to disengage proactively.  the av test driver took control based on their assessment that the ghost vehicle was driving too closely to the preceding vehicle in the particular driving environment.",194,Sensor,System

"the system disengaged due to undesirable performance, indicating in most cases either that the system took longer to operate than the prescribed limits, an exception condition or a software bug.  in each of these cases, the av operator was alerted to take control and did so without the need for the system to achieve a minimal risk condition.
