"another vehicle approaching target lane when the test vehicle inititated a lane change. limitation in software. this was a case of two vehicles trying to occupy the same space in a lane. our software has a limitation in that we do not (yet) cancel lane changes once it has been initiated; however, we do cancel lane changes if the software deems it unsafe prior to the actual maneuver. in this case we had already started the maneuver, therefore the driver had to take over. this isn t a software bug, it s a known issue that is being worked on. conditions: non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved.",28,Software,System
"attempting to lane change into a lane with stopped/slow traffic, and test vehicle was not slowing down enough. root cause: limited control actuation, detection issue. conditions: non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved.",4,Recognition System,ML/Design

"during a merge, the test vehicle failed to keep an appropriate distance between a merging car or the merging car failed to yield to us. 
root cause: test vehicle maintained the speed according to the speed limit. our sensors picked up a vehicle that was merging into our lane, but the software (in the us) has not been programmed to increase/decrease speed when a vehicle is merging even though we have the right way. conditions: non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved",4,Sensor,System

"the sw couldnt perform the manuever safely eg.: possible lane departure, too aggressive lane change manuever. root cause: lane detection issue. conditions: non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved.",37,Recognition System,ML/Design
"the software gave back control to the driver, due to a minor system error, conditions: non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved.
root cause: software kickout. there are criteria that the software needs to meet to be in a  healthy  state. if one of these has an error, the software hands back control to the driver for safety reasons. this kickout was related to the drive-by-wire system throwing a software fault indicating that the self-driving software application the operator uses to monitor the car s behavior needs to be restarted. this is not safety critical; it just means an application restart fixes the issue",1,Software,System
