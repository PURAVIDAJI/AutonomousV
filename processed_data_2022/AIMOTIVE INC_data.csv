2021-12,4T1B21HK6KU514747,Test driver,Freeway,"Another vehicle approaching target lane when the test vehicle inititated a lane change. Limitation in software. This was a case of two vehicles trying to occupy the same space in a lane. Our software has a limitation in that we do not (yet) cancel lane changes once it has been initiated; however, we do cancel lane changes if the software deems it unsafe prior to the actual maneuver. In this case we had already started the maneuver, therefore the driver had to take over. This isnï¿½t a software bug, itï¿½s a known issue that is being worked on. Conditions: Non-inclement weather, dry roads, no other factors involved."

Root Cause: Software kickout. There are criteria that the software needs to meet to be in a ï¿½healthyï¿½ state. If one of these has an error, the software hands back control to the driver for safety reasons. This kickout was related to the drive-by-wire system throwing a software fault indicating that the self-driving software application the operator uses to monitor the carï¿½s behavior needs to be restarted. This is not safety critical; it just means an application restart fixes the issue"

This was a case of two vehicles trying to occupy the same space in a lane. Our software has a limitation in that we do not (yet) cancel lane changes once it has been initiated; however, we do cancel lane changes if the software deems it unsafe prior to the actual maneuver. In this case we had already started the maneuver, therefore the driver had to take over. This isnï¿½t a software bug, itï¿½s a known issue that is being worked on.
